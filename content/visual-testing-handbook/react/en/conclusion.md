Congratulations! Visual testing is a practical way to verify that UI matches the intended design. You learned the basics to apply to your projects.

Storybook helps **build** components and write **test cases**. Running tests at the component level allows us to pinpoint the root cause of a change. Taking image snapshots automatically helps us catch **regressions**.

That means we can ship components without worrying about stowaway bugs. The whole workflow is illustrated below.
