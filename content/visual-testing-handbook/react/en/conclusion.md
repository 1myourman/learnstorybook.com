Congratulations! You started your journey into Visual Test-Driven Development. Along the way, you learnt how to isolate components, write test cases in Storybook and catch regressions with Chromatic.

Storybook helps us build components and write out test cases. Running tests at the component level allows us to pinpoint the root cause of a change. And by running automated snapshots, we can catch regressions. This helps us ship components without worrying about stowaway bugs. The whole workflow is illustrated below.
