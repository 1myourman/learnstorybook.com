Developing user interfaces has always been a bit of an art. In the past, the visual and subjective nature of the medium usually led to ad-hoc and ill-defined development processes. The lack of a unified approach makes it hard for developers to build genuinely excellent UIs quickly.

Throughout this chapter, we‚Äôll see how combining visual testing, and component explorers unlock the ability to build modular and extensible UIs in a rigorous test-driven fashion.

## How does it work?

**Visual TDD** applies the test-driven development process to UI components. It relies on supporting tools that enable a TDD-style workflow to make a once cumbersome a dead simple process.

## Test-Driven Development

One of the crucial advantages of modularization is **test-driven development(TDD)**. The idea of TDD is that you write your tests first before you write the functionality under test.

Practically, TDD is the process of **first** constructing a set of automated tests for your code and **second** writing the code itself to ‚Äúturn the tests green.‚Äù

TDD allows you to think clearly about what your code needs to do in terms of concrete inputs (for components, we refer to these as ‚Äústates‚Äù) and makes it easy to cover all use cases of your module. You can read more about it in many places, but [James Shore‚Äôs post](http://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad1/test_driven_development) on the subject is a good start.

It‚Äôs great for well-defined modules with precise inputs and outputs. For instance, if you are writing a `relativize` function that converts a date object to a string of the form ‚Äú2 weeks ago‚Äù, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward to outline all the various types of input you want to cover. And then, just hit the ‚Äútest‚Äù button each time you think you‚Äôve made progress toward a solution.

Your test framework allows you to run the relativize function in isolation without needing to provide input for your entire application just to test that one part.

However, TDD wavers when it‚Äôs hard to define unit tests ahead of time when your module is hard to isolate, and your outputs are hard to predict ahead of time. It's the perfect case for UIs without visual testing.

## Visual Testing

As mentioned in the [introduction chapter](/visual-testing-handbook/react/en/introduction/), visual testing bypasses the complexity of testing UIs by involving a human‚Äôs judgment in a quick and focused fashion.

> "The essential complexity of testing UIs is that it‚Äôs not usually possible to express the relevant visual details of interfaces through verification code."

In practice, visual testing uses a component explorer to manually and ‚Äúvisually‚Äù test a component across a set of defined test states. Although component explorers can help with much of the development process, from communicating designs to indexing components, testing a component‚Äôs behavior in a given state is the primary use case.

To write a visual test, we outline the state of the component we are interested in. In Storybook, we might write:

```js:title=src/components/Task.stories.js
import React from 'react';

import Task from './Task';

export default {
  component: Task,
  title: 'Task',
};

const Template = args => <Task {...args} />;

export const InboxTask = Template.bind({});
InboxTask.args = {
  task: {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Test Task',
    state: 'TASK_INBOX',
    updatedAt: new Date(2021, 0, 1, 9, 0),
    boardName: 'on Test Board',
  },
};

export const SnoozedTask = Template.bind({});
SnoozedTask.args = {
  task: {
    // Shaping the stories through args composition.
    ...InboxTask.args.task,
    state: 'TASK_SNOOZED',
  },
};

export const PinnedTask = Template.bind({});
PinnedTask.args = {
  task: {
    // Shaping the stories through args composition.
    ...InboxTask.args.task,
    state: 'TASK_PINNED',
  },
};
```

Then we can view the `Task` in the explorer.

  />

What we have produced above corresponds to the ‚Äú**execute**‚Äù phase of a test cycle; the ‚Äú**verify**‚Äù phase we do by eye. For UI testing, manually verifying is sometimes the best approach as it is robust to changes in the component that don‚Äôt affect the visual appearance. Additionally, because we only need to write our inputs ahead of time and visually check the output, we‚Äôre automatically building UIs in a TDD style.

## Visual TDD

If you are building an app from a well-thought-out design, the chances are that there are a set of well-specified components with inputs and outputs embedded in the design artifact.

Pair this ‚Äúdesign spec‚Äù with the visual testing process, and you can run an exact analogy to pure TDD. In the same way that visual testing requires a human element, visual TDD is ‚Äúimpure‚Äù in that you need to decide if a given test spec is passing manually. However, most of the notable advantages of TDD carry over:

- ‚úçüèΩ You specify a set of inputs to the component that cover all interesting use cases. It can often lead you to think about use cases that you wouldn‚Äôt consider if you developed it in a more ad-hoc way.

- üîç As you progress towards the solution, you can quickly and easily see how it performs under each spec.

- üìÅ The set of specs survive the development process and can be used to build a set of regression tests (to be done manually, perhaps optimized by snapshot testing).

## Next up: learn by doing

Whether or not you follow a rigorous TDD process or enjoy (finally!) writing visual tests for your components as you build them, once you try a component explorer and start building components in isolation, you‚Äôll see the benefits almost immediately.

In the next chapter, we will apply what we‚Äôve learned so far by building an example component using VTDD.
