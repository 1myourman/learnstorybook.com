**"Does it STILL look right?"**

Building UIs is only one part of frontend engineering. UIs must also stay reliable over time. But over the natural course of app development, changes inevitably cause UI regressions.

It's impractical to check for UI bugs in each `CommentList` state manually each time we push code. This chapter shows you how to automate visual testing using image snapshots.

## How does it work?

Visual test automation combines the accuracy of the human eye with the efficiency of machines. It doesn't remove people from the testing process. It use tools to focus human effort on the specific UI changes that require attention.

First, an image snapshot is taken for each component and variation as a "baseline" ‚Äì the last known good state of the UI. Whenever we push code, the machine will automatically take new snapshots and compare them pixel-by-pixel to the baseline snapshots.

If the machine detects UI changes, a human gets notified to confirm whether they're unintended bugs or intentional improvements.

We'll demonstrate how this all works using [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) by Storybook maintainers.

![How visual testing snapshots work](/visual-testing-handbook/how-snapshots work.png)

## Setup a repository in GitHub

Before we begin, our local code needs to sync with a remote version control service.

Go to GitHub and create a new repository for the project [here](https://github.com/new). Name the repo "commentlist", same as our local project.

![Set up comment list repo in GitHub](/visual-testing-handbook/commentlist-gh-repo-optimized.png)

Then follow the instructions to set up the repository:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/commentlist.git
git push -u origin main
```

<div class="aside">
üí° Don't forget to replace your-username with your account name.
</div>

## Setup Chromatic

First, go to [chromatic.com](https://www.chromatic.com/) and signup with your GitHub account.

![Chromatic sign in](/visual-testing-handbook/chromatic-sign-in-optimized.png)

From there, choose the repository you've just created.

<div class="aside">
 TODO: add video similar to the other tutorials (Intro Storybook and Design Systems) to select the repo in Chromatic
</div>

UI tests capture an image snapshot of every story in a cloud browser environment. Whenever you push code, Chromatic generates a new set of snapshots and compares them against baselines. If there are visual changes, you verify if they‚Äôre intentional.

### Establish baselines

Add Chromatic as a development package to your project:

```shell
yarn add -D chromatic
```

Once it‚Äôs finished installing, we have all that we need. Now is an excellent time to commit and push the changes to the remote repository.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Added Chromatic"
git push
```

Build and publish our Storybook with the following command:

```shell
yarn chromatic --project-token=<project-token>
```

<div class="aside">
üí° Don't forget to replace the <code>project-token</code> with one Chromatic supplies on the website.
</div>

![Chromatic running](/intro-to-storybook/chromatic-manual-storybook-console-log.png)

With this one command, you've published your Storybook and triggered Chromatic to capture an image snapshot of each story (in a standardized cloud browser) and set it as the baseline.

Subsequent builds will generate new snapshots that are compared against existing baselines to detect UI changes.

![Baselines in Chromatic](/visual-testing-handbook/commentlist-accepted-baselines-optimized.png)

### Run tests

Every time a pull request contains UI changes, big or small, it's helpful to run these checks. Chromatic will compare new snapshots to existing baselines from previous builds. The list of changes is shown on the build page in the web app. The build will be marked ‚Äúunreviewed‚Äù and the changes listed in the ‚ÄúTests‚Äù table.

Let's make a small UI change to demonstrate this concept.

```shell
git checkout -b change-commentlist-outline
```

Tweak the `CommentList` component

```diff:title=src/components/CommentList.js
import React from 'react';

import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import styled, { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components';

const CommentListDiv = styled.div`
  font-family: "Nunito Sans", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
  display: inline-block;

`;

const CommentItemDiv = styled.div`
  font-size: 12px;
  line-height: 14px;
  clear: both;
  height: 48px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0 0 10px 0;

  z-index: 1;
  background: #999;

const MessageDiv = styled.div`
  overflow: hidden;
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-right: 20px;

const AuthorSpan = styled.span`
  font-weight: bold;
`;
const TextSpan = styled.span``;

const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito+Sans:400,400i,800');
`;

export default function CommentList({ loading, comments, totalCount }) {
  if (loading) {
    return <div>empty</div>;
  }
  if (comments.length === 0) {
    return <div>loading</div>;
  }
  return (
    <>
    <GlobalStyle/>
    <CommentListDiv>
      {comments.map(({ text, author: { name, avatar } }) => (
        <CommentItemDiv key={`comment_${name}`}>
          <AvatarDiv>
            <AvatarImg src={avatar} />
          </AvatarDiv>
          <MessageDiv>
            <AuthorSpan>{name}</AuthorSpan> <TextSpan>{text}</TextSpan>
          </MessageDiv>
        </CommentItemDiv>
      ))}
    </CommentListDiv>
    </>
  );
}

CommentList.propTypes = {
  /**
   * Is the component in the loading state
   */
  loading: PropTypes.bool,

  /**
   * Total number of comments
   */
  totalCount: PropTypes.number,
  /**
   * List of comments
   */
  comments: PropTypes.arrayOf(
    PropTypes.shape({
      text: PropTypes.string,
      author: PropTypes.shape({
        name: PropTypes.string,
        avatar: PropTypes.string,
      }),
    })
  ),
};

CommentList.defaultProps = {
  loading: false,
  totalCount: 10,
  comments: [],
};

```

Commit the change, push it to the repo and run Chromatic:

```shell
git commit -am "make CommentList sparkle"
git push -u origin change-commentlist-outline
yarn chromatic --project-token=<project-token>
```

Open a pull request for the new branch in your GitHub repository.

### Review and merge changes

Visual regression testing ensures components don‚Äôt change by accident. But it‚Äôs still up to us to determine whether changes are intentional or not.

If a change is intentional we'll need to update the baseline so that future tests are compared to the latest version of the story. If a change is unintentional it needs fixing.

  <source
    src="/intro-to-storybook/website-workflow-review-merge-optimized.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

When we‚Äôve finished reviewing we‚Äôre ready to merge UI changes with confidence‚Äîknowing that updates won‚Äôt accidentally introduce bugs.

After you merge your code back into the target branch, Chromatic will also transfer the accepted baselines so that you only need to accept baselines a single time.

### Continuous integration

Running this command each time we make a change is tiresome. Ideally, we'd like to run these tests automatically whenever we push code. Chromatic can be used in CI/CD systems to indicate success and unblock deployment. [Learn about CI setup](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/ci).
