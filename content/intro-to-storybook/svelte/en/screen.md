We've concentrated on building UIs from the bottom up, starting small and adding complexity. Doing so has allowed us to develop each component in isolation, figure out its data needs, and play with it in Storybook. All without needing to stand up a server or build out screens!

In this chapter, we continue to increase the sophistication by combining components in a screen and developing that screen in Storybook.

## Nested container components

As our app is straightforward, the screen weâ€™ll build is pretty trivial, simply wrapping the `TaskList` component (which supplies its own data via Svelte Store) in some layout and pulling a top-level `error` field out of the store (let's assume we'll set that field if we have some problem connecting to our server).

Let's start by updating our Svelte store (in `src/store.js`) to include our new `error` field we want:

```diff:title=src/store.js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

const TaskBox = () => {
  // Creates a new writable store populated with some initial data
  const { subscribe, update } = writable([
    { id: '1', title: 'Something', state: 'TASK_INBOX' },
    { id: '2', title: 'Something more', state: 'TASK_INBOX' },
    { id: '3', title: 'Something else', state: 'TASK_INBOX' },
    { id: '4', title: 'Something again', state: 'TASK_INBOX' },
  ]);

  return {
    subscribe,
    // Method to archive a task, think of a action with redux or Vuex
    archiveTask: id =>
      update(tasks =>
        tasks.map(task => (task.id === id ? { ...task, state: 'TASK_ARCHIVED' } : task))
      ),
    // Method to archive a task, think of a action with redux or Vuex
    pinTask: id =>
      update(tasks =>
        tasks.map(task => (task.id === id ? { ...task, state: 'TASK_PINNED' } : task))
      ),
  };
};
export const taskStore = TaskBox();

+ // Store to handle the app state
+ const AppState = () => {
+  const { subscribe, update } = writable(false);
+  return {
+    subscribe,
+    error: () => update(error => !error),
+  };
+ };

+ export const AppStore = AppState();
```

Now that we have the store updated with the new field. Let's create `InboxScreen.svelte` in your `components` directory:

```svelte:title=src/components/InboxScreen.svelte
<script>
  import TaskList from './TaskList.svelte';
  export let error = false;
</script>

<div>
  {#if error}
    <div class="page lists-show">
      <div class="wrapper-message">
        <span class="icon-face-sad" />
        <div class="title-message">Oh no!</div>
        <div class="subtitle-message">Something went wrong</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  {:else}
    <div class="page lists-show">
      <nav>
        <h1 class="title-page">
          <span class="title-wrapper">Taskbox</span>
        </h1>
      </nav>
      <TaskList />
    </div>
  {/if}
</div>
```

We also need to change the `App` component to render the `InboxScreen` (eventually, we would use a router to choose the correct screen, but let's not worry about that here):

```svelte:title=src/App.svelte
<script>
  import './index.css'
  import { AppStore } from './store';
  import InboxScreen from './components/InboxScreen.svelte';
</script>

<InboxScreen error="{$AppStore}" />
```

<div class="aside">
ðŸ’¡ Don't forget to update the <code>TaskList</code> component and your unit tests to reflect the changes that were introduced.
</div>

However, where things get interesting is in rendering the story in Storybook.

As we saw previously, the `TaskList` component is a **container** that renders the `PureTaskList` presentational component. By definition, container components cannot be simply rendered in isolation; they expect to be passed some context or connected to a service. What this means is that to render a container in Storybook, we must mock (i.e., provide a pretend version) the context or service it requires.

When placing the `TaskList` into Storybook, we were able to dodge this issue by simply rendering the `PureTaskList` and avoiding the container. We'll do something similar and render the `InboxScreen` in Storybook also.

So when we set up our stories in `InboxScreen.stories.js`:

```js:title=src/components/InboxScreen.stories.js
import InboxScreen from './InboxScreen.svelte';

export default {
  component: InboxScreen,
  title: 'InboxScreen',
};

const Template = args => ({
  Component: InboxScreen,
  props: args,
});

export const Default = Template.bind({});

export const Error = Template.bind({});
Error.args = {
  error: true,
};
```

We see that both the `error` and `standard` stories work just fine. (But you will encounter some problems when trying to test the `InboxScreen` with a unit test if no data is supplied as we did with `TaskList`).

Cycling through states in Storybook makes it easy to test weâ€™ve done this correctly:

## Interactive stories

So far, we've been able to build a fully functional application from the ground up, starting from a simple component up to a screen and continuously testing each change using our stories. But each new story also requires a manual check on all the other stories to ensure the UI doesn't break. That's a lot of extra work.

Can't we automate this workflow and interact with our components automatically?

Storybook's [`play`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/svelte/writing-stories/play-function) function allows us to do just that. A play function includes small snippets of code that are run after the story renders.

The play function helps us verify what happens to the UI when tasks are updated. It uses framework-agnostic DOM APIs, that means we can write stories with the play function to interact with the UI and simulate human behavior no matter the frontend framework.

Let's see it in action! Update your newly created `PureInboxScreen` story, and set up component interactions by adding the following:

```diff:title=src/components/InboxScreen.stories.js
+ import { fireEvent, within } from '@storybook/testing-library';
import InboxScreen from './InboxScreen.svelte';

export default {
  component: InboxScreen,
  title: 'InboxScreen',
};

const Template = args => ({
  Component: InboxScreen,
  props: args,
});

export const Default = Template.bind({});

export const Error = Template.bind({});
Error.args = {
  error: true,
};

+ export const WithInteractions = Template.bind({});
+ WithInteractions.play = async ({ canvasElement }) => {
+   const canvas = within(canvasElement);
+   // Simulates pinning the first task
+   await fireEvent.click(canvas.getByLabelText("pinTask-1"));
+   // Simulates pinning the third task
+   await fireEvent.click(canvas.getByLabelText("pinTask-3"));
+ };
```

Check your newly created story. Click the `Interactions` panel to see the list of interactions inside the story's play function.

<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
  <source
    src="/intro-to-storybook/storybook-interactive-stories-play-function.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

The play function allows us to interact with our UI and quickly check how it responds if we update our tasks. That keeps the UI consistent at no extra manual effort. All without needing to spin up a testing environment or add additional packages.

## Component-Driven Development

We started from the bottom with `Task`, then progressed to `TaskList`, now weâ€™re here with a whole screen UI. Our `InboxScreen` accommodates a nested container component and includes accompanying stories.

  <source
    src="/intro-to-storybook/component-driven-development-optimized.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

[**Component-Driven Development**](https://www.componentdriven.org/) allows you to gradually expand complexity as you move up the component hierarchy. Among the benefits are a more focused development process and increased coverage of all possible UI permutations. In short, CDD helps you build higher-quality and more complex user interfaces.

Weâ€™re not done yet - the job doesn't end when the UI is built. We also need to ensure that it remains durable over time.
